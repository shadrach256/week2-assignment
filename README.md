Python List Operations Example
A simple Python script demonstrating basic list operations such as appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding the index of an element.

📋 Code Overview
This program performs the following operations on a list called my_list:

Creates an empty list.

Appends elements [10, 20, 30, 40].

Inserts 15 at the second position.

Removes the last element.

Sorts the list in ascending order.

Finds and prints the index of the value 30.
